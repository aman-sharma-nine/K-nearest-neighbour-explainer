# K-nearest-neighbour-explainer
In this project, we will be predicting car prices using k-nearest neighbour algorithm.  
This project will help you practice the machine learning workflow and logic behind the algorithm.  
The dataset is obtained from : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile
